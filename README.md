- 👋 Hi, I’m @lushmana
- 👀 I’m a grumpy old programmer, who started with VB 1.0 and continued through to VB 6 before jumping over to Delphi, then onto c#. 
In recent years I have migrated onto functional languages, such as Rust and Elixir. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Elixir & Phoenix Liveview
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to retiring, so that I can work on my own projects, not ones I'm told to do.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
